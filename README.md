# AI_Entrance_Counter
It is used to count the entrance traffic using AI object detection. With the help of real time optical flow detection, it can detect IN/OUT status of different people. However, the algorithm may be too computational expensive for Nvidia Jetson TX2. Further optimization is required in the future.
